irccloud-solarized
==================

Use the solarized color scheme for irccloud chat.

This style replaces the default ("Dawn") color scheme with solarized-light. A dark version is planned; it will replace the dark ("Dusk") theme. If the style doesn't seem to be applying, go to the settings and select the Solarized theme.

At the moment, some elements of the UI (menu popups, etc.) are still unstyled, this is a work in progress.

Installation
------------

Recommended (stable):

Go to https://userstyles.org/styles/121074/irccloud-solarized and
install it via the Stylish browser extension. This will automatically update
whenever I make a release.

Alternative (dev versions):

*These instructions no longer work; I have to find an automated way to build the css file to fix them*

From within the Stylish extension, use the "Install from URLsâ€¦"
option, and enter the URL
https://rawgit.com/kepstin/irccloud-solarized/master/irccloud-solarized.user.css
This will automatically update (more or less) whenever I push a commit to the
git repository.

Note that the dev version only includes Firefox syntax for include rules; it
will not work in Chrome. Chrome users, please use the userstyles.org version
instead.
