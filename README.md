irccloud-solarized
==================

Use the solarized color scheme for irccloud chat.

This style replaces the default ("Dawn") color scheme with solarized-light. A dark version is planned; it will replace the dark ("Dusk") theme. If the style doesn't seem to be applying, go to the settings and select the Solarized theme.

At the moment, some elements of the UI (menu popups, etc.) are still unstyled, this is a work in progress.

Installation
------------

Recommended (stable):
Go to https://userstyles.org/styles/121074/irccloud-solarized and
install it via the Stylish browser extension. This will automatically update
whenever I make a release.

Alternative (dev versions):
From within the Stylish extension, use the "Install from URLsâ€¦"
option, and enter the URL
https://cdn.rawgit.com/kepstin/irccloud-solarized/master/irccloud-solarized.user.css
This will automatically update whenever I push a commit to the git repository.
